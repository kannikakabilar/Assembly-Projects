# DateToDayCalculator
I worked on a small project to demonstrate my understanding of the assembly language. This project is written in x86 assembly.
<br />The program prompts user to input a date and uses it to calculate the day number in that year from 1 to 365 (or 366 in leap year).

- How to run this program <br />
This program can be easily run in VS code. Open VS code, click on 'Extensions' on left panel and search 'masm'. Install MASM/TASM <br />
Open file: daydate.asm
<br />
When opened, right click on a line of code in the file and click: 'Run ASM code'
<br />
An image of the executing program is shown below.
